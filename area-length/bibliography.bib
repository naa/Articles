	abstract = {We study the boundary correlation functions in Liouville theory and in
solvable statistical models of 2D quantum gravity. In Liouville theory
we derive functional identities for all fundamental boundary structure
constants, similar to the one obtained for the boundary twopoint
function by Fateev, Zamolodchikov and Zamolodchikov. All these
functional identities can be written as difference equations with
respect to one of the boundary parameters. Then we switch to the
microscopic realization of 2D quantum gravity as a height model on a
dynamically triangulated disc and consider the boundary correlation
functions of electric, magnetic and twist operators. By cutting open
the sum over surfaces along a domain wall, we derive difference
equations identical to those obtained in Liouville theory. We conclude
that there is a complete agreement between the predictions of
Liouville theory and the discrete approach.  1

	abstract = {For random collections of self-avoiding loops in two-dimensional
domains, we define a simple and natural conformal restriction property
that is conjecturally satisfied by the scaling limits of interfaces in
models from statistical physics. This property is basically the
combination of conformal invariance and the locality of the
interaction in the model. Unlike the Markov property that Schramm used
to characterize SLE curves (which involves conditioning on partially
generated interfaces up to arbitrary stopping times), this property
only involves conditioning on entire loops and thus appears at first
glance to be weaker. Our first main result is that there exists
exactly a one-dimensional family of random loop collections with this
property--one for each κ ∈ (8/3, 4]--and that the loops are forms of
SLEκ . The proof proceeds in two steps. First, uniqueness is
established by showing that every such loop ensemble can be generated
by an "exploration" process based on SLE. Second, existence is
obtained using the two-dimensional Brownian loop-soup, which is a
Poissonian random collection of loops in a planar domain. [abriged]},

  abstract={Consider a bounded planar domain D, an instance h of the Gaussian free
field on D, with Dirichlet energy (2π)–1 D ∇h(z) . ∇h(z)dz, and a
constant 0 <= γ < 2. The Liouville quantum gravity measure on D is the
weak limit as ε -> 0 of the measures 2 εγ /2 eγhε (z) dz, where dz is
Lebesgue measure on D and hε (z) denotes the mean value of h on the
circle of radius ε centered at z. Given a random (or deterministic)
subset X of D one can define the scaling dimension of X using either
Lebesgue measure or this random measure. We derive a general quadratic
relation between these two dimensions, which we view as a
probabilistic formulation of the Knizhnik, Polyakov, Zamolodchikov
(KPZ, 1988) relation from conformal field theory. We also present a
boundary analog of KPZ (for subsets of ∂D). We discuss the connection
between discrete and continuum quantum gravity and provide a framework
for understanding Euclidean scaling exponents via quantum gravity.  *

  abstract={Conformally-invariant curves that appear at critical points in
twodimensional statistical mechanics systems, and their fractal
geometry have received a lot of attention in recent years. On the one
hand, Schramm [1] has invented a new rigorous as well as practical
calculational approach to critical curves, based on a beautiful
unification of conformal maps and stochastic processes, and by now
known as Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE). On the other hand,
Duplantier [2, 3] has applied boundary quantum gravity methods to
calculate exact multifractal exponents associated with critical
curves. In the first part of this paper I provide a pedagogical
introduction to SLE. I present mathematical facts from the theory of
conformal maps and stochastic processes related to SLE. Then I review
basic properties of SLE and provide practical derivation of various
interesting quantities related to critical curves, including fractal
dimensions and crossing probabilities. The second part of the paper is
devoted to a way of describing critical curves using boundary
conformal field theory (CFT) in the socalled Coulomb gas formalism.
This description provides an alternative (to quantum gravity) way of
obtaining the multifractal spectrum of critical curves using only
traditional methods of CFT based on free bosonic fields.  1   Contents},
