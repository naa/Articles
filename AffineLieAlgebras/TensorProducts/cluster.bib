Abstract      = {In this paper we use the combinatorics of alcove walks to give a uniform
combinatorial formula for Macdonald polynomials for all Lie types. These
formulas are generalizations of the formulas of Haglund-Haiman-Loehr for
Macdonald polynoimals of type GL(n). At q=0 these formulas specialize to the
formula of Schwer for the Macdonald spherical function in terms of positively
folded alcove walks and at q=t=0 these formulas specialize to the formula for
the Weyl character in terms of the Littelmann path model (in the positively
folded gallery form of Gaussent-Littelmann).},

dimensional graded modules for the current algebra associated to a
simple Lie algebra. These modules are indexed by an |R+ |-tuple of
partitions ξ = (ξ α ), where α varies over a set R+ of positive roots
of g and we assume that they satisfy a natural compatibility
condition. In the case when the ξ α are all rectangular, for instance,
we prove that these modules are Demazure modules in various levels. As
a consequence we see that the defining relations of Demazure modules
can be greatly simplified. We use this simplified presentation to
relate our results to the fusion products, defined in [15], of
representations of the current algebra. We prove that the Q-system of
[22] extends to a canonical short exact sequence of fusion products of
representations associated to certain special partitions ξ. Finally,
in the last section we deal with the case of sl2 and prove that the
modules we define are just fusion products of irreducible
representations of the associated current algebra and give monomial
bases for these modules.},

successive quotients are Demazure modules which occur in a level
-integrable module for A1 as long as is large. We associate to each
partition and 1 to each an edge-labeled directed graph which allows us
to describe in a combinatorial way the graded multiplicity of a given
level -Demazure module in the filtration. In the special case of the
partition 1s and = 2, we give a closed formula for the graded
multiplicity of level two Demazure modules in a level one Demazure
module. As an application, we use our result along with the results of
Naoi and Lenart et al., to give the character of a g1 stable level one
Demazure module associated to Bn as an explicit combination of
suitably specialized Macdonald polynomials. In the case of sl2 , we
also study the filtration of the level two Demazure module by level
three Demazure modules and compute the numerical filtration
multiplicities and show that the graded multiplicites are related to

  abstract={In this paper, we construct graded tensor product characters in terms
of generalized difference Macdonald raising operators which form a
representation of the quantum Q-system. Characters for the graded
tensor product of Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules were expressed as the
constant term of a non-commutative generating function [DFK14]. This
function is written in terms of the generators of a quantum cluster
algebra, subject to recursion relations known as the quantum Q-system.
The latter form a discrete non-commutative integrable system, with a
set of commuting conserved quantities. In type A such conserved
quantities can be treated as analogues of the Casimir elements of Uq
(slr+1 ). We show that the graded tensor product character is the
analogue of a class I Whittaker function (to which it reduces in the
Demazure case), and that the difference equations which follow from
the action of the conserved quantities on characters generalize the
difference quantum Toda equations of Etingof [Eti99]. [abriged]},
