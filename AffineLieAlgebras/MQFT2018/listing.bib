  abstract={We study the boundary correlation functions in Liouville theory and in
solvable statistical models of 2D quantum gravity. In Liouville theory
we derive functional identities for all fundamental boundary structure
constants, similar to the one obtained for the boundary twopoint
function by Fateev, Zamolodchikov and Zamolodchikov. All these
functional identities can be written as difference equations with
respect to one of the boundary parameters. Then we switch to the
microscopic realization of 2D quantum gravity as a height model on a
dynamically triangulated disc and consider the boundary correlation
functions of electric, magnetic and twist operators. By cutting open
the sum over surfaces along a domain wall, we derive difference
equations identical to those obtained in Liouville theory. We conclude
that there is a complete agreement between the predictions of
Liouville theory and the discrete approach.  1

  abstract={For random collections of self-avoiding loops in two-dimensional
domains, we define a simple and natural conformal restriction property
that is conjecturally satisfied by the scaling limits of interfaces in
models from statistical physics. This property is basically the
combination of conformal invariance and the locality of the
interaction in the model. Unlike the Markov property that Schramm used
to characterize SLE curves (which involves conditioning on partially
generated interfaces up to arbitrary stopping times), this property
only involves conditioning on entire loops and thus appears at first
glance to be weaker. Our first main result is that there exists
exactly a one-dimensional family of random loop collections with this
property--one for each κ ∈ (8/3, 4]--and that the loops are forms of
SLEκ . The proof proceeds in two steps. First, uniqueness is
established by showing that every such loop ensemble can be generated
by an "exploration" process based on SLE. Second, existence is
obtained using the two-dimensional Brownian loop-soup, which is a
Poissonian random collection of loops in a planar domain. [abriged]},

bridges and self-avoiding polygons. A detailed proof that the
connective constant on the hexagonal lattice √ equals 2 + 2 is then
provided. The lace expansion for self-avoiding walks is described, and
its use in understanding the critical behaviour in dimensions d > 4 is
discussed. Functional integral representations of the self-avoiding

renormalisation group analysis in dimension 4 is sketched. Problems

multiplicities associated to integrable highest weight representations of the
simplest affine Lie algebra $A_1^{(1)}$. At $t=1$, these reduce to the {\em
string functions} of $A_1^{(1)}$, which were shown by Kac and Peterson to be
related to certain Hecke indefinite modular forms. Using their methods, we
obtain a description of the general $t$-string function; we show that its
values can be realized as radial averages of a certain extension of the Hecke
indefinite modular form.},

  abstract={Zamolodchikov found an integrable field theory related to the Lie
algebra E8 , which describes the scaling limit of the Ising model in a
magnetic field. He conjectured that there also exist solvable lattice
models based on E8 in the universality class of the Ising model in a
field. The dilute A3 model is a solvable lattice model with a critical
point in the Ising universality class. The parameter by which the
model can be taken away from the critical point acts like a magnetic
field by breaking the Z2 symmetry between the states. The expected
direct relation of the model with E8 has not been found hitherto. In
this letter we study the thermodynamics of the dilute A3 model and
show that in the scaling limit it exhibits an appropriate E8
structure, which naturally leads to the E8 scattering theory for
massive excitations over the ground state.},

Abstract      = {We develop a general method to compute correlation functions of fractional
quantum Hall (FQH) states on a curved space. In a curved space, local
transformation properties of FQH states are examined through local geometric
variations, which are essentially governed by the gravitational anomaly.
Furthermore, we show that the electromagnetic response of FQH states is related
to the gravitational response (a response to curvature). Thus, the
gravitational anomaly is also seen in the structure factor and the Hall
conductance in flat space. The method is based on iteration of a Ward identity
obtained for FQH states.},

compact Riemann surface of genus g. For the case g > 0 these theories
are parameterized by holomorphic line bundles of degree g – 1, and for
the case g = 0 -- by smooth closed Jordan curves on the complex plane.
In both cases we define a notion of τ -function as a partition
function of the theory and evaluate it explicitly. For the case g > 0
the τ -function is an analytic torsion [3], and for the case g = 0 --
the regularized energy of a certain natural pseudo-measure on the
interior domain of a closed curve. For these cases we rigorously prove
the Ward identities for the current correlation functions and
determine them explicitly. For the case g > 0 these functions coincide
with those obtained in [21, 36] using bosonization. For the case g = 0
the τ -function we have defined coincides with the τ -function
introduced in [29, 44, 24] as a dispersionless limit of the Sato's τ
-function for the two-dimensional Toda hierarchy. As a corollary of
the Ward identities, we obtain recent results [44, 24] on relations
between conformal maps of exterior domains and τ -functions. [abriged]},

  abstract={Conformally-invariant curves that appear at critical points in
twodimensional statistical mechanics systems, and their fractal
geometry have received a lot of attention in recent years. On the one
hand, Schramm [1] has invented a new rigorous as well as practical
calculational approach to critical curves, based on a beautiful
unification of conformal maps and stochastic processes, and by now
known as Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE). On the other hand,
Duplantier [2, 3] has applied boundary quantum gravity methods to
calculate exact multifractal exponents associated with critical
curves. In the first part of this paper I provide a pedagogical
introduction to SLE. I present mathematical facts from the theory of
conformal maps and stochastic processes related to SLE. Then I review
basic properties of SLE and provide practical derivation of various
interesting quantities related to critical curves, including fractal
dimensions and crossing probabilities. The second part of the paper is
devoted to a way of describing critical curves using boundary
conformal field theory (CFT) in the socalled Coulomb gas formalism.
This description provides an alternative (to quantum gravity) way of
obtaining the multifractal spectrum of critical curves using only
traditional methods of CFT based on free bosonic fields.  1   Contents},

Abstract      = {Results from exact diagonalization show that the spin-polarized Coulomb
ground state at nu=5/2 is adiabatically connected with the Moore-Read wave
function for systems with up to Nel = 16 electrons on the surface of a sphere.
Varying the Haldane pseudopotentials v1 and v3, keeping all others at their
value for Coulomb interaction, energy gap and (v1,v3)-dependent ground state
overlap with the Moore-Read state form two ridges whose peak positions and
extent in the (v1,v3)-plane essentially coincide. Thus, the physics of the
Coulomb ground state at nu=5/2 is indeed captured by the Moore-Read state and
that non-Abelian statistics can be expected under experimental conditions. Such
adiabatic connection is not observed at nu=1/2, unless the width of the
interface wave function and/or Landau level mixing effects are sufficiently
large. Varying the width, an excitation gap is found for all system sizes Nel
\le 18 studied. However, its system size dependence casts doubt on the
existence of a Moore-Read-phase at nu=1/2 in the thermodynamic limit.},

square lattice was started in 1940s. It was developed by many people

opinion, this standard discretization does not preserve well-known
remarkable features of the Completely Integrable System. These
features certainly characterize the standard Cauchy Continuous Complex
Analysis. They played a key role in the great success of Complex
Analysis in Mathematics and Applications. Few years ago we developed
jointly with I.Dynnikov a New Discretization of Complex Analysis (DCA)
based on the two-dimensional manifolds with colored black/white
triangulation (see [9]). Especially deep results were obtained for the
Euclidean plane with equilateral triangle lattice in the works [9,
10]. Our approach preserves a lot of features of Completely Integrable
Systems. In the present work we develop a DCA theory for the analogs
of equilateral triangle lattice in the Hyperbolic plane. This case is
much more difficult than Euclidean. Many problems (easily solved for
the Euclidean Plane) are not solved here yet. [abriged]},

We prove the graded version of the M = N identities, and write

a simple reformulation of Feigin and Loktev's fusion coefficients as
matrix elements in a representation of the quantum Q-system algebra.},

  abstract={We explore various aspects of the correspondence between dimer models
and integrable systems recently introduced by Goncharov and Kenyon.
Dimer models give rise to relativistic integrable systems that match
those arising from 5d N = 1 gauge theories studied by Nekrasov. We
apply the correspondence to dimer models associated to the Y p,0
geometries, showing that they give rise to the relativistic
generalization of the periodic Toda chain originally studied by
Ruijsenaars. The correspondence reduces the calculation of all
conserved charges to a straightforward combinatorial problem of
enumerating non-intersecting paths in the dimer model. We show how the
usual periodic Toda chain emerges in the non-relativistic limit and
how the Lax operator corresponds to the Kasteleyn matrix of the dimer
model. We discuss how the dimer models for general Y p,q manifolds
give rise to other relativistic integrable systems, generalizing the
periodic Toda chain and construct the integrable systems for general Y
p,p explicitly. The impurities introduced in the construction of Y p,q
quivers are identified with impurities in twisted sl(2) XXZ spin
chains. [abriged]},

having a remarkable combinatorial structure. They were introduced by Fomin and
Zelevinsky in 2000 in the context of Lie theory, but have since appeared in
many other contexts, from Poisson geometry to triangulations of surfaces and
Teichm\"uller theory. In this expository paper we give an introduction to
cluster algebras, and illustrate how this framework naturally arises in
Teichm\"uller theory. We then sketch how the theory of cluster algebras led to
a proof of the Zamolodchikov periodicity conjecture in mathematical physics.},

algebras generalizing cluster algebras of Fomin and Zelevinsky. These
algebras contain odd coordinates that anticommute with each other and
square to zero. A cluster superalgebra is defined with the help of a
quiver satisfying some conditions and specific transformations called
mutations. Generators of a cluster superalgebra are Laurent
polynomials with denominators given by even monomials. Both, mutations
and exchange relations, generalize the classical ones. Every cluster
superalgebra admits a presymplectic form invariant under mutations.
Our main series of examples of cluster superalgebras is provided by
superfriezes arXiv:1501.07476, analogous to Coxeter's frieze patterns.

Abstract      = {We consider the Forrester-Baxter RSOS lattice models with crossing parameter
$\lambda=(m'\!-\!m)\pi/m'$ in Regime~III. In the continuum scaling limit, these
models are described by the minimal models ${\cal M}(m,m')$. We conjecture
that, for $\lambda<\pi/n$, the $n\times n$ fused RSOS models with $n\ge 2$ are
described by the higher-level coset $(A^{(1)}_1)_k\otimes
(A^{(1)}_1)_n/(A^{(1)}_1)_{k+n}$ at fractional level $k=nM/(M'\!-\!M)-2$ with
$(M,M')=\big(nm-(n\!-\!1)m',m'\big)$. To support this conjecture, we
investigate the one-dimensional sums arising from Baxter's off-critical corner
transfer matrices. In unitary cases ($m=m'\!-\!1$) it is known that, up to
leading powers of $q$, these coincide with the branching functions
$b_{r,s,\ell}^{m'\!-n,m'\!,n}(q)$. For general nonunitary cases ($m<m'\!-\!1$),
we identify the ground state one-dimensional RSOS paths and relate them to the
quantum numbers $(r,s,\ell)$ in the various sectors. For $n=1,2,3$, we obtain
the local energy functions $H(a,b,c)$ in a suitable gauge and verify that the
associated one-dimensional sums produce finitized forms that converge, as $N$
becomes large, to the fractional level branching functions
$b_{r,s,\ell}^{M,M'\!,n}(q)$. Extending the work of Schilling, we also
conjecture finitized bosonic branching functions
$b_{r,s,\ell}^{M,M'\!,n;(N)}(q)$ for general $n$ and check that these agree
with the one-dimensional sums for $n=1,2,3$ out to system sizes $N=14$. Lastly,
the finitized Kac characters $\chi_{r,s,\ell}^{P,P'\!,n;(N)}(q)$ of the
$n\times n$ fused logarithmic minimal models ${\cal LM}(p,p')$ are obtained by
taking the {\em logarithmic limit\/} $m,m'\to\infty$ with $m/m'\to p/p'+$.},

PrimaryClass  = {math-ph},
Abstract      = {This monograph is dedicated to a generalization of the L\"owner equation in
its stochastic form known as SLE, and to its coupling with the Gaussian free
field, ultimately aiming at the construction of a boundary conformal field
theory with one free scalar bosonic field. This study is presented in line with
a systematic, and hopefully concise, presentation and generalization of known
elements of the theory of L\"owner evolution. We also study the relation to
singular representations of the Virasoro algebra and methods of numerical
simulation. The main results are in the proof of the basic properties of the
generalized SLE and general necessary and sufficient conditions for the
coupling. We also introduce a machinery that possesses to consider all L\"owner
equations and known types of the coupling as different manifestations of the
same thing.},
